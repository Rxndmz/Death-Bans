# Death Bans

The code for this plugin may not be the nicest as it was done awhile ago but still works.

This is a minecraft 1.16 spigot plugin I made for an SMP with friends that would temp ban someone if they were to die.

The plugin is pretty customizable and can be done so through the config.yml
